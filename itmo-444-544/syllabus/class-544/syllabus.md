### Course Catalog Description 

Computing applications hosted on dynamically-scaled virtual resources available as services are considered. Collaborative and non-collaborative "cloud-resident" applications are analyzed with respect to cost, device/location independence, scalability, reliability, security, and sustainability. Commercial and local cloud architectures are examined. A group-based integration of course topics will result in a project employing various cloud computing technologies.

### Required Textbook

No required textbook

You will be using an existing or creating an account at [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/ "AWS Web services URL"). This will require a Credit Card for registration purposes -- but there won't be any extra cost.

### Readings 

Readings for the class will be assigned from the textbooks; there will be additional reading assigned in the form of online reading. All readings should be done before coming to class on the assigned date, and are mandatory and expected. Generally if you do the readings you will excel in the course, as the lectures serve as a clarification and explanation of material you should already be familiar with. Completion of reading may be verified by quizzes. Specific readings are assigned by topic above.

### Course Notes  

It is recommended to take notes from the oral discussion portion of the class.

### Attendance 

Attendance is expected and will be counted as part of your grade.  

### Canvas

We will be using Canvas as the new LMS for communications, assignment submissions, group project coordination, providing online resources and administering examinations. All remote students will view the course lectures online via Canvas, and online readings and other course material will be found on Canvas.

Mobile apps available

* [Android Canvas](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.instructure.candroid&hl=en_US "Android Canvas")
* [iOS Canvas](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/canvas-student/id480883488 "iOS Canvas")

### Zoom Stream

Courses will be streamed by Zoom (link available in the Canvas course section) and available on demand under the **Panopto Video Link** in Canvas.

### Assignments

Project/Examination: Based on the six chapters covered, there will be a graduate design project, 6 labs, 3 Mini Coding Projects, 1 Final project with presentation during the final exam period.

All Work will be pushed to a GitHub private repository that you will be given access to by the professor.

### Grading Grading criteria for students will be as follows:

Letter | Description | Percentage
-------|-------------|------------
A | Outstanding work reflecting substantial effort | 90-100%
B | Adequate work fully meeting that expected of a graduate student | 80-89.99%
C | Weak but marginally satisfactory work not fully meeting expectations | 65-79.99%
E | Unsatisfactory work | 0-64.99%

The final grade for the class will be calculated as follows:

   Name                  Grade    Total Points
----------------------- ------- ----------------
  Review Questions (6):   15%        120
               Lab (6):   15%        120
                   MP1:   13%        100
                   MP2:   13%        100

### Late Submission Policy 

By default no late work will be accepted – barring situations beyond our control.

### Academic Honesty

All work you submit in this course must be your own.

### Plagiarism 

You must fully attribute all code you use and find. This is required by citation rules (such as Stack Overflow) and is good practice.  All code must be your own.

### Collaboration 

Students may only collaborate on assignments or projects that are explicitly designated as group assignments or projects. Students submitting work that is identical or in some cases even substantively the same will be asked to discuss the assignment with me. If one student admits to having copied the work, or if there is clear evidence who is guilty, the guilty student will be assigned a grade of zero. If no one admits to the offense or a reasonable determination of guilt cannot be made, each student involved will be assigned a grade of zero. In either case, an Academic Honesty Violation Report will be filed, and it may result in your expulsion from the course with a failing grade as per the IIT and ITM academic honesty policies.

### Our Contract

This syllabus is my contract with you as to what I will deliver and what I expect from you. If I change the syllabus, I will issue a revised version of the syllabus; the latest version will always be available on Blackboard. Revisions to readings and assignments will be communicated via Blackboard.

### Disabilities 

Reasonable accommodations will be made for students with documented disabilities.  In order to receive accommodations, students must obtain a letter of accommodation from the Center for Disability Resources and make an appointment to speak with me as soon as possible.  My office hours are listed on the first page of the syllabus. The Center for Disability Resources (CDR) is located in 3424 S. State St., room 1C3-2 (on the first floor), telephone 312 567.5744 or disabilities@iit.edu.

### ARC Tutoring Center 

The university provides a free tutoring and study center called the [ARC](https://www.iit.edu/arc "IIT Resource Center URL").  This is located newly in the basement of the Galvin Library and is open to all for walk in appointments as well as scheduled tutoring. This is open to all students at no cost.

### Illinois Tech’s Sexual Harassment and Discrimination Information 

Illinois Tech prohibits all sexual harassment, sexual misconduct, and gender discrimination by any member of our community. This includes harassment among students, staff, or faculty. Sexual harassment of a student by a faculty member or sexual harassment of an employee by a supervisor is particularly serious. Such conduct may easily create an intimidating, hostile, or offensive environment.

Illinois Tech encourages anyone experiencing sexual harassment or sexual misconduct to speak with the Office of Title IX Compliance for information on support options and the resolution process. You can report sexual harassment electronically at iit.edu/incident report, which may be completed anonymously. You may additionally report by contacting the Title IX Coordinator, Virginia Foster at foster@iit.edu or the Deputy Title IX Coordinator at eespeland@iit.edu.

For confidential support, you may reach Illinois Tech’s Confidential Advisor at (773) 907-1062. You can also contact a licensed practitioner in Illinois Tech’s Student Health and Wellness Center at student.health@iit.edu or (312)567-7550

For a comprehensive list of resources regarding counseling services, medical assistance, legal assistance and visa and immigration services, you can visit the Office of Title IX Compliance website at [https://www.iit.edu/title-ix/resources](https://www.iit.edu/title-ix/resources "Title IX Compliance website").
