## Course Catalog Description

This course will cover the fundamental concepts and philosophy behind free and open source software (FOSS). The course will discuss open source and free software licensing; open source business strategies and impact; FOSS utilization in the enterprise; and development methodologies. Students will learn to set up and configure an industry-standard open source operating system, including system installation, and basic system administration; system architecture; package management; command–line commands; devices, filesystems, and the filesystem hierarchy standard. Also addressed are applications, shells, scripting and data management; user interfaces and desktops; administrative tasks; essential system services; networking fundamentals; and security, as well as support issues for open source software. Multiple distributions are covered with emphasis on the two leading major distribution forks.

### Required Textbook

Understanding Free and Opensource Operating Systems, The Technology and Philosophy Of - Part I
Author: Jeremy Hajek

OpenSource and freely available (and often updated) [https://github.com/jhajek/Linux-text-book-part-1/releases](https://github.com/jhajek/Linux-text-book-part-1/releases "Github URL to class textbook")


#### Readings

Readings for the class will be assigned from the textbooks; there will be additional reading assigned in the form of online reading. All readings should be done before coming to class on the assigned date, and are mandatory and expected. Generally if you do the readings you will excel in the course, as the lectures serve as a clarification and explanation of material you should already be familiar with. Completion of reading may be verified by quizzes. Specific readings are assigned by topic above.

#### Course Notes

It is recommended to take notes from the oral discussion portion of the class.

### Attendance

Attendance is expected and will be counted as part of your grade.  

### Course Web Site

[http://blackboard.iit.edu/](http://blackboard.iit.edu/ "Course Document Mangement Site URL")

### Blackboard

The course will make intensive use of Blackboard [http://blackboard.iit.edu/](http://blackboard.iit.edu/ "Course Document Mangement Site URL") for communications, assignment submissions, group project coordination, providing online resources and administering examinations. All remote students will view the course lectures online via Blackboard, and online readings and other course material will be found on Blackboard.

### Assignments

* 1 Review Questions on Blackboard
* 1 Podcast Q&A
* 1 Laboratory due each week.

12 weeks worth

### Grading

Grading criteria for students will be as follows:

### Late Submission

By default no late work will be accepted – barring situations beyond our control.

### Academic Honesty

All work you submit in this course must be your own. This also includes use of ChatGPT and other Generative AI. We will be discussing these things and exposing you to this. If you are curious how to use it or want to explore using this, come and see me and we can talk about it.

### Plagiarism

You must fully attribute all material directly quoted in papers and you must document all sources used in the preparation of the paper using complete, APA-style bibliographic entries. Including directly quoted material in an assignment without attribution or a bibliography entry for the source of the material is always plagiarism and will always be treated as such by me. No more than thirty-three percent of material included in any paper may be direct quotes. Students have submitted plagiarized material in seven of the last eight times I have taught this course and I will not tolerate it. If you submit plagiarized material you WILL receive a grade of ZERO for the assignment or exam question, an Academic Honesty Violation Report will be filed, and it may result in your expulsion from the course with a failing grade as per the IIT and ITM academic honesty policies. There is no excuse for not understanding this policy and if you do not understand it please let me know and I will be happy to discuss it with you until you do.

### Collaboration

Students may only collaborate on assignments or projects that are explicitly designated as group assignments or projects. Students submitting work that is identical or in some cases even substantively the same will be asked to discuss the assignment with me. If one student admits to having copied the work, or if there is clear evidence who is guilty, the guilty student will be assigned a grade of zero. If no one admits to the offense or a reasonable determination of guilt cannot be made, each student involved will be assigned a grade of zero. In either case, an Academic Honesty Violation Report will be filed, and it may result in your expulsion from the course with a failing grade as per the IIT and ITM academic honesty policies.

### Our Contract

This syllabus is my contract with you as to what I will deliver and what I expect from you. If I change the syllabus, I will issue a revised version of the syllabus; the latest version will always be available on Blackboard. Revisions to readings and assignments will be communicated via Blackboard.

### Disabilities

Reasonable accommodations will be made for students with documented disabilities.  In order to receive accommodations, students must obtain a letter of accommodation from the Center for Disability Resources and make an appointment to speak with me as soon as possible.  My office hours are listed on the first page of the syllabus. The Center for Disability Resources (CDR) is located in 3424 S. State St., room 1C3-2 (on the first floor), telephone 312 567.5744 or disabilities@iit.edu.

### ARC Tutoring Center

The university provides a free tutoring and study center called the [ARC](https://www.iit.edu/arc "IIT Resource Center URL").  This is located newly in the basement of the Galvin Library and is open to all for walk in appointments as well as scheduled tutoring.

### Illinois Tech’s Sexual Harassment and Discrimination Information

Illinois Tech prohibits all sexual harassment, sexual misconduct, and gender discrimination by any member of our community. This includes harassment among students, staff, or faculty. Sexual harassment of a student by a faculty member or sexual harassment of an employee by a supervisor is particularly serious. Such conduct may easily create an intimidating, hostile, or offensive environment.

Illinois Tech encourages anyone experiencing sexual harassment or sexual misconduct to speak with the Office of Title IX Compliance for information on support options and the resolution process. You can report sexual harassment electronically at iit.edu/incident report, which may be completed anonymously. You may additionally report by contacting the Title IX Coordinator, Virginia Foster at foster@iit.edu or the Deputy Title IX Coordinator at eespeland@iit.edu.

For confidential support, you may reach Illinois Tech’s Confidential Advisor at (773) 907-1062. You can also contact a licensed practitioner in Illinois Tech’s Student Health and Wellness Center at student.health@iit.edu or (312)567-7550

For a comprehensive list of resources regarding counseling services, medical assistance, legal assistance and visa and immigration services, you can visit the Office of Title IX Compliance website at [https://www.iit.edu/title-ix/resources](https://www.iit.edu/title-ix/resources "Title IX Compliance website").
