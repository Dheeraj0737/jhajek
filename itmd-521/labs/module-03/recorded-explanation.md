## Objectives

* Video record your learnings from the lab
* Answer the questions to explain your work briefly

## Outcomes

* At the completion of this video recording part of Lab 01, you will have compiled a significant Spark application with an explanation of how the code works. 

## Pre-reqs

For this portion of the assignment you will need to have software installed on your computer to be able to screen record, record audio, and record your web cam to produce and explanation video for your homework submission. The recommended software is [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/download "webpage for OBS Project") which is used by many podcasters and streamers to produce videos. As long as you can meet all three requirements for this portion, you are free to use other software.

## Deliverable Requirements

Upon completing the lab, record a video not less than 3 minutes and not more than 5, to explain your work and output based on the questions listed below. Upload the video to Canvas.  Double check your video before uploading to see if the audio and screen recording is done correctly.

* Are you loading the M&M data set filename through the command line or using the absolute path to the file?
* What function are you using to read data from a file into a dataframe?
* For your results, which state and color has the top 2 highest count?
* How did you filter data for CA? What is the least count and color of M&M for CA?
