~~Each non-presenting team must prepare and additional two short answer review questions, per chapter covered and submit them to Canvas by the Friday prior to the weeks presentation so that the team and the instructor have a chance to cover the material during the Monday presentation.~~

Answering these questions:

1) Did the team make a clear introduction of the material that would be presented? If not, briefly explain what was missing or deficient?
1) Briefly explain the main theme of the chapter.
1) Did the team provide three review questions and three additional resources at the end of the presentation? If not, briefly explain what was missing or deficient?
