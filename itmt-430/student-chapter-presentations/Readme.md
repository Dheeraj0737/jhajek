### Submitted Questions

All submitted questions will become part of a pool for the final exam

### Project Deliverables

Submit which ever notes / presentation platform you have prepared and a second copy with the detailed answers provided to BlackBoard the Thursday by 5:00 PM, so I have time to give you feedback before your Monday's presentation.
