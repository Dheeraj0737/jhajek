## Where are you from?

From the Chicago suburbs, Lombard and Glen Ellyn (30 miles west of campus).

## IT Interest

My background is in IT Orchestration and Operations.  I had been an IT manager before previously becoming a professor in 2012.  I came to the realization that cloud native development and deployment (DevOps) was the logical outcome of the Unix way of thinking.

## Something Interesting About You

It doesn't look like it now, but I played American Football in high school and junior college.  I managed to register one tackle to my credit at the NCIA level - I also was the second person to graduate from the ITM degree as an undergrad in 2004.

A little know fact, being in my mid 40s I was part of the early internet and was partially responsible for creating "Rick-rolling".  If you don't believe me, check out these links to prove this fact: [links:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ "definitely not rick-rolling you...")
