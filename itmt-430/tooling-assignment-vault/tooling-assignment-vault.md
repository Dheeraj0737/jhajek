# Tooling Assignment Vault

Provide the required screenshots to show the completion of the tutorial for the local Packer build and the remote Build Server build.

## Vagrant Box List

Take a screenshot of the command: `vagrant box list` to show the ubuntu-server on your local host.

## cat TEST file

Issue the command `vagrant up` and `vqagrant ssh` and the command `~~echo~~ cat /home/vagrant/TEST`. This will display the content of a FILE named test which will print out the DBUSER value and demonstrate that you have succesfully passed a secret via Vault.  Take a screenshot of this output.
