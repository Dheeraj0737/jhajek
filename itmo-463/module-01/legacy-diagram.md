Prepare your thoughts and notes ahead of time and using a recording service such as Loom or OBS, create a short video 2 to 4 minutes (not less than 2, no more than 4), showing your face the entire time. You may also use YouTube and set your video as unlisted so it is not open to the public. At the beginning of the video, be sure to introduce yourself, identify the date, and identify the course you are taking. For example: Hi, my name is John Smith. Today is August 15th, 2024 and I am taking ITMO463. 

Requirements:

Evaluate and explain the flow of the application would take if a user was uploading an image to an EC2 instance with a webserver and the application was making a customer entry in the database

You may use visual aids/screenshare.

Deliverable:

Submit the video link to access the recording.
