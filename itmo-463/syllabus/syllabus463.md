**Course Outcomes:**

This course will enable students to be ready to design, build, and implement logging and metrics in monitored applications. Implementing these foundations will allow any system administrator to integrate logging and metric collection to correlate with business objectives.

**Course Student Outcomes:** Students completing this course will be able to:

* Implement the concepts of cloud computing and cloud-native applications in a three-tier web application 
* Discuss design decisions for constructing cloud native applications 
* Describe the five components of Cloud 
* Explain and evaluate current tooling used in building and deploying cloud native applications 
* Explain and discuss the various public cloud service that can be used for developing cloud-native 
applications 
* Demonstrate and deploy an application to a cloud platform using a cloud native process  
* Explain and discuss the concept of orchestration.

**Topics to Be Covered**:

* Declarative Programming
* Function as a Service (Lambda)
* Event Triggers
* Automation
* APIs
* Infrastructure Modelling

**Required Textbook:**

No required textbook - article links will be provided

**Course Notes:**  It is recommended to take notes from the oral discussion portion of the class.

**Course Web Site:** We will be using Canvas for the course

**Assignments:**  There will be 7 weekly assignments and 1 final presentation

**Grading:** Grading criteria for (undergrad course number) students will be as follows:

Letter | Description | Percentage
-------|-------------|------------
A | Outstanding work reflecting substantial effort | 90-100%
B | Excellent work reflecting good effort | 80-89.99%
C | Satisfactory work meeting minimum expectations | 70-79.99%
D | Substandard work not meeting expectations | 60-69.99%
E | Unsatisfactory work | 0-59.99%

The final grade for the class will be calculated as follows: (example)

| Name                 | Grade | Total Points |
| ----------------------- | ------- | ---------------- |
|   Weekly Assignments: | 50% | 70 |
|         Final Project: | 50% | 70 |

**Late Submission:**  By default no late work will be accepted – barring situations beyond our control.

**Academic Honesty:**  All work you submit in this course must be your own.

**Plagiarism and AI:** I would like to generally recognize that LLM and gAI products do exist and that they are very useful and powerful. There is no restriction on using these tools, but I would like to caution you that you will have to verbally explain your code as part of your deliverables. Best to use these tools as helpers not as something that can do your work. Always cite any use of an LLM along with the prompt used to generate it.

**Our Contract:** This syllabus is my contract with you as to what I will deliver and what I expect from you. If I change the syllabus, I will issue a revised version of the syllabus; the latest version will always be available on Canvas. Revisions to readings and assignments will be communicated via Canvas.

**Disabilities:** Reasonable accommodations will be made for students with documented disabilities.  In order to receive accommodations, students must obtain a letter of accommodation from the Center for Disability Resources and make an appointment to speak with me as soon as possible.  My office hours are listed on the first page of the syllabus. The Center for Disability Resources (CDR) is located in 3424 S. State St., room 1C3-2 (on the first floor), telephone 312 567.5744 or disabilities@iit.edu.

**ARC Tutoring Center:** The university provides a free tutoring and study center called the [ARC](https://www.iit.edu/arc "IIT Resource Center URL").  This is located newly in the basement of the Galvin Library and is open to all for walk in appointments as well as scheduled tutoring.

**Illinois Tech’s Sexual Harassment and Discrimination Information:** Illinois Tech prohibits all sexual harassment, sexual misconduct, and gender discrimination by any member of our community. This includes harassment among students, staff, or faculty. Sexual harassment of a student by a faculty member or sexual harassment of an employee by a supervisor is particularly serious. Such conduct may easily create an intimidating, hostile, or offensive environment.

Illinois Tech encourages anyone experiencing sexual harassment or sexual misconduct to speak with the Office of Title IX Compliance for information on support options and the resolution process. You can report sexual harassment electronically at iit.edu/incident report, which may be completed anonymously. You may additionally report by contacting the Title IX Coordinator, Virginia Foster at foster@iit.edu or the Deputy Title IX Coordinator at eespeland@iit.edu.

For confidential support, you may reach Illinois Tech’s Confidential Advisor at (773) 907-1062. You can also contact a licensed practitioner in Illinois Tech’s Student Health and Wellness Center at student.health@iit.edu or (312)567-7550

For a comprehensive list of resources regarding counseling services, medical assistance, legal assistance and visa and immigration services, you can visit the Office of Title IX Compliance website at [https://www.iit.edu/title-ix/resources](https://www.iit.edu/title-ix/resources "Title IX Compliance website").
