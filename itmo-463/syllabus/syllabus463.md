**Course Outcomes:**

This course will enable students to be ready to design, build, and implement logging and metrics in monitored applications. Implementing these foundations will allow any system administrator to integrate logging and metric collection to correlate with business objectives.

**Course Student Outcomes:** Students completing this course will be able to:

* Implement the concepts of cloud computing and cloud-native applications in a three-tier web application 
* Discuss design decisions for constructing cloud native applications 
* Describe the five components of Cloud 
* Explain and evaluate current tooling used in building and deploying cloud native applications 
* Explain and discuss the various public cloud service that can be used for developing cloud-native 
applications 
* Demonstrate and deploy an application to a cloud platform using a cloud native process  
* Explain and discuss the concept of orchestration.

**Topics to Be Covered**:

* Monitoring & Measurement Frameworks
* Managing events and Metrics & Graphing
* Event Routing and Collection
* Containers and Logs
* Building an app & Notifications
* Getting Started & Monitoring Nodes
* Service Discovery
* Alerting & Scaling and Reliability
* Instrumenting Applications & Logging
* Building Monitored Applications & Notification

**Required Textbook:**

**Course Notes:**  It is recommended to take notes from the oral discussion portion of the class.

**Course Web Site:** We will be using Canvas for the course

**Assignments:**  5 tooling assignments and 5 Mini-Projects (MPs)

**Grading:** Grading criteria for (undergrad course number) students will be as follows:

Letter | Description | Percentage
-------|-------------|------------
A | Outstanding work reflecting substantial effort | 90-100%
B | Excellent work reflecting good effort | 80-89.99%
C | Satisfactory work meeting minimum expectations | 70-79.99%
D | Substandard work not meeting expectations | 60-69.99%
E | Unsatisfactory work | 0-59.99%

The final grade for the class will be calculated as follows: (example)

| Name                 | Grade | Total Points |
| ----------------------- | ------- | ---------------- |
|   Tooling Assignments: | 10% | 50 |
|                MP 1-5: | 50% | 200 |                 
|         Final Project: | 40% | 150 |

**Late Submission:**  By default no late work will be accepted – barring situations beyond our control.

**Academic Honesty:**  All work you submit in this course must be your own.

**Plagiarism:** You must fully attribute all material directly quoted in papers and you must document all sources used in the preparation of the paper using complete, APA-style bibliographic entries. Including directly quoted material in an assignment without attribution or a bibliography entry for the source of the material is always plagiarism and will always be treated as such by me. No more than thirty-three percent of material included in any paper may be direct quotes. Students have submitted plagiarized material in seven of the last eight times I have taught this course and I will not tolerate it. If you submit plagiarized material you WILL receive a grade of ZERO for the assignment or exam question, an Academic Honesty Violation Report will be filed, and it may result in your expulsion from the course with a failing grade as per the IIT and ITM academic honesty policies. There is no excuse for not understanding this policy and if you do not understand it please let me know and I will be happy to discuss it with you until you do.

**Our Contract:** This syllabus is my contract with you as to what I will deliver and what I expect from you. If I change the syllabus, I will issue a revised version of the syllabus; the latest version will always be available on Canvas. Revisions to readings and assignments will be communicated via Canvas.

**Disabilities:** Reasonable accommodations will be made for students with documented disabilities.  In order to receive accommodations, students must obtain a letter of accommodation from the Center for Disability Resources and make an appointment to speak with me as soon as possible.  My office hours are listed on the first page of the syllabus. The Center for Disability Resources (CDR) is located in 3424 S.
